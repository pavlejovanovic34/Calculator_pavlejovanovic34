Introduction
For your second project you'll build a Console Calculator App with the help of Microsoft’s Documentation. If this is your first time building a project on your own, I suggest you first watch this series from our C# Foundation area, where we walk you through how to create a console app from scratch, while explaining important concepts in C#. If you have already watched it, or created applications before, this will be a breeze. But it’s still helpful to reinforce your knowledge.

It will also serve as practice in a very important skill: following written documentation. This is something you’ll be doing on a regular basis as a professional developer, so it’s essential that you’re comfortable applying text-based instructions when developing software.


Requirements
This project has only one requirement:


 Complete the following tutorial: Create a Calculator App (Microsoft Docs)

Resources
The instructions for this project are based on Visual Studio for Windows. The code you will write will be the same regardless of the code editor, but the process of creating a new project will differ. Here are links about how to create a console app with different editors:

 Visual Studio For Mac
 Visual Studio Code

Tips
 Don't forget to ALWAYS, I mean ALWAYS have your code saved on Github (or whatever source control you use). This way you won't lose your work, and you can always refer back to it in the future. You're building a library of your own!
 Don't rush through the steps, even if this tutorial is easy for you. Make sure you understand EACH WORD of the code. Leave no stone unturned.
 If there's anything you don't understand, hover over the code, and you'll get an explanation of what the term means. If you still can't understand it, google is your best friend. You'll find explanations about pretty much everything in forums like stackoveflow.com.
 If this is your first project, I recommend doing it twice. You'll be surprised at how much your retention increases, and how many gaps were left in the first time.
 Upon completion of your project, go to our Discord community and brag about it! It's a very important step to complete a project and you should celebrate.

Challenges
 Create a functionality that will count the amount of times the calculator was used.
 Store a list with the latest calculations. And give the users the ability to delete that list.
 Allow the users to use the results in the list above to perform new calculations.
 Add extra calculations: Square Root, Taking the Power, 10x, Trigonometry functions.
